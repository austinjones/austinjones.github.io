    At the Department of Pharmacoepidemiology, I built applications which supported the ad-hoc analysis of pharmaceutical adverse reaction data.  
    
    The applications allowed researchers to quickly examine statistical indicators across large numbers of drugs, and identify areas for further study.

    I spent my high school internship at the MIT Media Lab, assisting in research on human-computer interaction.
    - Simplified the use of and maintained a driving simulator designed for research applications. Built
    software to transform XML descriptions of driving worlds into the STISIM tabular world definition
    format, providing the user stochastic macros to generate rich world definitions from simple input.
    - Implemented tools, applications, and data analysis software to effectively measure user productivity
    during disruptive interruptions. Built software to read interaction logs, and aggregate 'brand new'
    statistical measures of productivity over many contexts (such as Current Window or Current Task).
