    My first job was at the MIT Media Lab, assisting in research on human-computer interaction.
    - Simplified the use of and maintained a driving simulator designed for research applications. Built
    software to transform XML descriptions of driving worlds into the STISIM tabular world definition
    format, providing the user stochastic macros to generate rich world definitions from simple input.
    - Implemented tools, applications, and data analysis software to effectively measure user productivity
    during disruptive interruptions. Built software to read interaction logs, and aggregate 'brand new'
    statistical measures of productivity over many contexts (such as Current Window or Current Task).
