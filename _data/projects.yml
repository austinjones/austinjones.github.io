    Dali is a GPU rendering library that uses GPU texture sampling to generate high-quality digital paintings.

    High Resolution output is critical for canvas prints, but most generative art frameworks (such as Processing) are slow at these resolutions.

    See an example on [GitHub](https://github.com/austinjones/dali-rs), or a one of [my works](https://austinjones.onfabrik.com/portfolio/texture-from-nothing).

    An exploration of Normalizing Flows
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I implemented several types of Normalizing Flows in Swift for Tensorflow, and Pytorch.  My goal was to apply normalizing flows to small-scale problems, and develop a framework for benchmarking their performance.

    I discovered a method which can measure performance at any layer, not just at the end of the network.
