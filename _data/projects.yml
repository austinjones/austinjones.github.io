    Tab is an intuitive, config-driven terminal multiplexer designed for software & systems engineers.  
    Tab is designed to navigate between contexts, rather than multi-task.  And designed to provide persistent historical context,
    rather than throwaway workspaces.


    Tab is fast: tabs launch in 50ms, and reconnect in 10ms. Keyboard latency (stdin to stdout) is under 5ms.

  description: >
    Lifeline is a dependency injection library for async message-based applications, 
    written in Rust and inspired by [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Motivation).  
    Lifeline uses the DI pattern to reduce direct dependencies between components of an application, 
    allowing individual components to be more easily tested, refactored, or replaced.


    Rather than using Interfaces/Traits as the abstraction, Lifeline uses concrete message types.
    Lifeline applications define event-based, reactive tasks which wait for messages, maintain state
    on their stack, and transmit output messages.

    Generating quality images for print on canvas is suprisingly difficult.  To avoid 'pixelation', a 20x20" 
    canvas requires 8k x 8k resolution (or more).  For large pieces (40" to 60") you need extreme resolution.


    At these resolutions, performance is critical.  Dali is a GPU rendering library that leverages texture 
    sampling & fragment shaders to generate rich texture at these resolutions.  It can generate instant previews, 
    and production renders in a few minutes.


    To see it 'in production', see one of [my works](https://austinjones.onfabrik.com/portfolio/texture-from-nothing).
