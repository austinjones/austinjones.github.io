    Dali is a GPU rendering library that leverages texture sampling to generate high-quality digital paintings.

    High Resolution output is critical for canvas prints, but most generative art frameworks can't generate output at the needed resolution, or take hours to render.

    See an example on [GitHub](https://github.com/austinjones/dali-rs), or a one of [my works](https://austinjones.onfabrik.com/portfolio/texture-from-nothing).

    An exploration of Normalizing Flows
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I implemented several types of Normalizing Flows in Pytorch, and Swift for Tensorflow.  My goal was to apply normalizing flows to small-scale problems, and develop a framework for benchmarking their performance.

    I discovered a method which can measure performance at any layer, not just at the end of the network.
