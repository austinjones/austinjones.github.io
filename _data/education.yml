    Since third grade I have been homeschooled in the Boston area which has an active and diverse homeschooling community.
    Homeschooling gave me the flexibility to study my passions: Mathematics, Music and Programming, 
    while still providing support in other subjects such as History, Literature, Science, Physics/Engineering, and Writing.
