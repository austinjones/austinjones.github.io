    From 3rd Grade, I was homeschooled.  Boston has a great homeschooling community, and it gave me the flexibility to advance quickly where I could, and time to study my passions: Mathematics and Programming. 

    In my teens, Harvard Extension provided a great resource for more formal learning, on English, Psychology, and Mathematics.

    Homeschooling also allowed the time for high school internships at the MIT Media Lab, and Harvard Medical School.
