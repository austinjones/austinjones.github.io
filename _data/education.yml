    Since third grade I have been homeschooled in the Boston area, which has an active and diverse homeschooling community. Homeschooling gave me the flexibility and time to study my passions: Mathematics and Programming. I advanced quickly and beginning in my early teens I started taking Harvard Extension classes which provided a great resource for more formal learning on diverse subjects including English, Psychology, and Mathematics.
    
    I was also able to pursue high school internships at the MIT Media Lab and Harvard School of Public Health.
