    Since third grade I have been homeschooled in the Boston area, which has an active and diverse homeschooling community. Homeschooling gave me the flexibility and time to study my passions: Mathematics and Programming. I advanced quickly and beginning in my early teens I started taking Harvard Extension classes which provided a great resource for more formal learning on diverse subjects including Animal Psychology, English, and Mathematics, and Musical Composition.

    I was also able to pursue high school internships at the MIT Media Lab and Harvard School of Public Health.
