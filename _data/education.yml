    I was homeschooled in the Boston area, which has an active and diverse homeschooling community.
    Homeschooling gave me the flexibility to study my passions: Mathematics, Music and Programming, 
    while still providing foundation in other subjects such as History, Literature, Physics/Engineering, and Writing.


    The mix of formal and self-guided work provided me with the unique ability to be highly productive in self-study.  
    Homeschooling taught me how to choose what to learn and how to self-check my understanding.
