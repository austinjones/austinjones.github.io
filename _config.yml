  Hi, I'm Austin.  I'm a professional Backend Engineer, with extensive <mark>Java</mark> and <mark>Rust</mark> experience.


  At work I design, build, and deploy <mark>Spring Boot</mark> services.  I've also done Systems work, mostly on <mark>AWS</mark>, 
  deploying Dockerized applications on EC2, and ALB/ECS.


  In my spare time I'm a Generative Artist (see [my portfolio](https://austinjones.onfabrik.com/portfolio/texture-from-nothing)).  
  I use Rust and GPUs to generate intricate images for canvas prints.  I use <mark>Machine Learning</mark> to solve creative problems 
  in <mark>Pytorch</mark> and <mark>Swift for Tensorflow</mark>.
